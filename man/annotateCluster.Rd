\usage{
annotateCluster(object,clusters = "consensusClusters",filterCluster = TRUE
, filterClusterThreshold = 0.02, annotationType = "genes",upstream=1000
, upstreamOverlap = 500,downstream = 0)

  object,
  clusters = "consensusClusters",
  filterCluster = TRUE,
  filterClusterThreshold = 0.02,
  annotationType = "genes",
  upstream = 1000,
  upstreamOverlap = 500,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A TSSr object}

\item{clusters}{Clusters to be annotated: "consensusClusters" or "tagClusters".
Default is "consensusClusters".}

\item{filterCluster}{Logical indicating whether clusters downstream of a highly
expressed cluster are filtered. Setting filterCluster as "TRUE" would reduce weak
clusters brought from recapping, transcriptional or sequencing noise. Default is TRUE.}

\item{filterClusterThreshold}{Ignore downstream clusters if signal < filterClusterThreshold*the
strongest clusters within the same gene promoter region. Default value = 0.02.}

\item{annotationType}{Specify annotation feature to be associated with: "genes"
or "transcripts". Default is "genes".}

\item{upstream}{Upstream distance to the start position of annotation feature.
Default value = 1000.}

\item{upstreamOverlap}{Upstream distance to the start position of annotation
feature if overlapped with the upstream neighboring feature. Default value = 500.}

\item{downstream}{Downstream distance to the start position of annotation feature.
Default value = 0. Note: if annotationType == "transctipt" or the gene annotations
start from transcription start sites (TSSs), the recommended value = 500.}
}
\value{
Large List of elements - one element for each sample
}
\description{
Annotates clusters with gene or transcript names from GFF annotation file.
